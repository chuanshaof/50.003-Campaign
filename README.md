Description: Consider a CSV file that stores a list of records (e.g., records of bank accounts).
You are required to write a software program that reads two such CSV files, compares records
stored in these CSV files row by row against a unique combination and records all mismatches
as exceptions. Finally, the software program generates another csv file listing the exceptions.

To utilize the Main file, enter 2 files into the arguements pertaining to the absolute path of the file. The output of the file will show the mismatched lines and will output a file titled "./mismatch.csv".
